Solution - Key insights for Business

1.	Sales reps with consistent performance over the quarters have been found out. This helps our clients to decide on the incentives or the respective sales reps to reward their efforts.

2.	Found the HCPs who have the most prescriptions writing. This information can be used by the business to conduct speaker programs where these HCPs can be the speaker in a doctors conference and talk about the products he’s prescribing. This is a very effective method in bringing other doctors in writing prescriptions for those products. Since Sales rep promoting a product to a HCP would not be as effective.

3.	Territories with maximum sales helps business to understand how their sales are in specific territory. With this they would be able to understand the kind of demographic information that plays a key role in why specific territories are doing well compared to others.

4.	Market share of the products manufacturers by the client helps to re-prioritize and plan the budgets for the upcoming quarters in terms of strategy.
